## Advanced House Price Regression
 A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

The company wants to know: Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

## General Information
 We have to come up with a model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

Following steps will be followed for building Advance Regression Model

## Conclusions
Overall quality: If the Overall Quality is Excellent than the SalePrice is higher
Neighborhood : If the location is near Northridge Heights, Timberland and Old Town than the SalePrice is higher
Exterior1st : If the Exterior covering on house is of Cement Board or Hard Board than the SalePrice is higher
HouseStyle: If the style of the house is Split Foyer than the SalePrice is higher
MSZoning: If the zone of the house is Floating Village Residential than the SalePrice is higher
Condition1: If the Proximity to various conditions such as Near positive off-site feature--park, greenbelt, etc. than also SalePrice is higher
